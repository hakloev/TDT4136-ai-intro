## How-To ##

The code is implemented with python3, so to run the code you have to use python3.

* Usage: python3 filename.py [boardNumber]
  * boardNumber must be 1-1 or 2-1 and so on. 
  * If no board number is sent in as argument, 1-1 and 2-1 will be choosen as default.
* Available files:
  * astar1.py (implementation of astar algorithm).
  * astar2.py (implementation of astar algorithm with cost).
  * astar3_bfs.py (implementation of bfs-search).
  * astar3_dijkstra.py (implementation of dijkstra's algorithm).
* To see opened and closed nodes when displaying path, set the debug-argument in the AStar class to True.
